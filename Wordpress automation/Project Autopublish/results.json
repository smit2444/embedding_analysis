The online information ecosystem is so large and complex, and the threat of scams and inauthentic material is so advanced, that it is sometimes difficult for people to trust what they see online, which in turn is affecting the trustworthiness of critical and longstanding institutions of our society. This project's goal is fundamental research to investigate and construct a framework for ultimately helping people find and share safe, useful, and trustworthy information in cyberspace. The framework will include tools for identifying original sources and authentic information.<br/> <br/>This project includes investigations of social network information sharing online. The project is studying audience resilience using inoculation theory and leveraging peer networks for authenticity dissemination. The project also includes vulnerability assessment models to identify the most effective labeling measures and the individuals and communities most in need of support of their information needs. The planned framework focuses on utilizing social network structures rather than specific content types. Ultimately, the project aims to enhance the strength of the online information ecosystem by leveraging computational methods and network analysis techniques.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

        "title": "EAGER: Foundations for the Systematic Study of Synthetic Data",
        "abstractText": "Advancements in data-driven models in various fields like natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics have been made possible due to the availability of large amounts of data. However, concerns about privacy rights have been growing, leading to the need for strategies that protect individual data while still allowing data sharing. Synthetic data offers a potential solution by preserving the statistical properties of the original data while removing any personally identifiable information. Although many methods for generating synthetic data have been proposed, there is still a lack of solid theoretical foundations in this area. This project bridges the gap between theory and practice. The project's novelties are in developing the fundamental principles for the systematic study of synthetic data, and in clarifying the technical vocabulary and the associated concepts. The project's broader significance and importance is in its ability to allow institutions to articulate, enforce, evaluate, and validate their required constraints for synthetic data generation methodologies, significantly accelerating data-sharing. With heightened privacy and enhanced utility hand in hand, this framework will shape a world where privacy is safeguarded, knowledge is shared, and AI-based methods truly flourish for the betterment of humanity.<br/> <br/>The project conceptualizes the philosophical considerations of synthetic data, establishes properties of synthetic data, develops formal definitions of what it means to be \u201csynthetic\u201d, and develops a comprehensive evaluation framework for synthetic data that includes curated datasets, metrics, and baselines. The research improves our scientific understanding of privacy, utility, and synthetic data. The project also cultivates the integration of research and education, by providing new security or privacy projects for undergraduate and graduate research and outreach activities, and serves as an invaluable teaching tool and excellent entry point into the field of privacy and security research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

        "abstractText": "The Broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to intercepting landfill-destined carbon fiber \u2013 designated as off-spec fibers - and repurpose it into sustainable nonwoven fabrics. Off-spec carbon fiber constitutes 30% of carbon fiber production. These sustainable fabrics will be categorized based on their performance characteristics into multiple tiers that are suitable for different scales of applications. In addition, this project will explore the hybridization of natural fiber and off-spec carbon fiber for increased sustainability. The results of this project may serve as a baseline for industry to adopt these fabrics into their composites to create lighter automotive vehicles with lower emissions. The advanced composites made from the resulting fabrics may introduce new, high-performance materials that can be used for the development of medical devices, lightweight unmanned aircrafts, and electronic enclosures with applications in the automotive, aerospace, sporting, and marine industries, and beyond.<br/><br/>The proposed innovation to produce nonwoven fabrics from off-spec carbon fiber is based on the fundamental studies of their physical and chemical properties and their responses to mechanical agitation and suspension in an aqueous solutions. This effort focuses on dispersing mechanisms for the wet laid process. This technology may lead to a mathematical model that can receive inputs about fibers properties and predict a mixing regime that will provide dispersion conditions for an optimal nonwoven fabric. Such models can be supported with thorough, standardized, quality control and mechanical testing. This project objectives are to establish process to fabricate mats using off-spec materials, including trims, and recycled fibers and to optimize operations for mats made from different combinations of blended carbon fiber tiers. Mixtures of different fractional percentages and types of on- and off-spec carbon fibers will be used, and models will be adjusted to reflect optimal operational settings.  Finally, the team will compare the performance of tailored mixed-material carbon fiber mats against those produced using only carbon fibers to expand products applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

        "abstractText": "There is currently no known cure or effective vaccine for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. In the absence of a vaccine, the most effective strategy for preventing HIV transmission is to implement the \u201ctreatment as prevention\u201d approach, that is, antiretroviral medication to achieve undetectable viral load in patients, thereby preventing sexual transmission. For treatment and cure of HIV infection, one of the viable options is to begin therapy early in infection before the establishment of virus reservoirs such as latent infected CD4+ T cells and infected brain cells. This project develops and uses mathematical models of cell-virus interactions and computational methods to study the effectiveness of early antiretroviral therapy (ART), including a recently developed nanoparticle-based preventive therapy (NBPT), for treatment of HIV. The study will focus on HIV infections in three critical sites: vaginal mucosa, circulation, and brain. In addition to improving our current knowledge of HIV transmission dynamics, pathogenesis, and nanomedicine, this research will have a significant positive and practical impact on the development of therapies and vaccines for the control of HIV.<br/><br/>This project aims to generate novel nonautonomous systems of differential equations to study the effects of ART pharmacodynamics on the spatiotemporal distribution of HIV virus in vaginal mucosa and on the persistence of HIV in the virus reservoirs. The project will utilize experimental data from HIV infected humans and SIV (Simian Immunodeficiency Virus) infected macaques, as well as data from experiments on effectiveness of ARTs and NBPTs, for the model validation and the parameter estimation. The developed models will be extensively analyzed using dynamical systems theory as well as statistical, numerical, and machine learning methods. Mathematical and computational challenges anticipated in this research will offer opportunities to develop innovative techniques that advance the field of applied non-autonomous complex differential equations as well as optimal control theory. This project will also broaden the application of differential equation modeling to a machine learning framework. The results, including optimal treatment protocols, are intended help to inform evidence-based guidelines for managing, preventing, and curing HIV infection via early ARTs and NBPTs, thereby enhancing the quality of life for HIV infected patients.

What about that package from Amazon? While there is much speculation, we really do not know the answers to these very basic questions about how and where the virus lives outside of humans. The goal of this research is to determine if surfaces commonly touched by humans, but not routinely disinfected, are important for the spread of CoVID-19. Such surfaces will be tested for the presence of the virus. Results will be used to develop new mathematical models to determine if commonly touched surfaces are important for spreading CoVID-19. This research is important not only for society's response to CoVID-19 but also to plan for future pandemics caused by other viruses. The project will also help train the next generation of scientists who study the ecology and spread of disease. <br/><br/>This project will collect thousands of surface swab samples from hundreds of sites around San Diego, USA. The samples will be screened for SARS-CoV-19 using the Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reactions (RT-PCR). These data will be used to calibrate, fit and validate dynamical models that describe SARS-CoV-2 transmission from the environmental reservoirs. From these models, important characters of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, including risk of human infections from environmental reservoirs and contribution of environmental reservoirs to the basic reproduction number (R0) of the virus, will be estimated. The swab samples will also be characterized by metatranscriptomics for other viruses and microbes living on the same surfaces. This will be valuable for understanding the community ecology of these micro-environments and serve as a baseline for future studies. Together these intellectual products will have practical impact on controlling CoVID-19 by helping determine whether more effort should be put on disinfecting these surfaces or controlling the virus in other reservoirs.<br/><br/>This RAPID award is made by the Population and Community Ecology Program in the Division of Environmental Biology, using funds from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

        "abstractText": "The successful containment of pandemics such as COVID-19 requires the ability to record the presence of infections and track its spread within communities. While testing is the primary source to collect such information, the lack of testing resources and the resultant under-testing significantly hampers this effort. Mobile crowdsensing is an alternative technological approach that can be effective in such situations if used by a significant fraction of the population. However, privacy concerns as well as the stigma associated with the pandemic prove to be huge barriers that inhibit the accurate collection of information in this way. The goal of this project is to develop an infrastructure and platform to collect data from the population and distill it into aggregate information to provide insight to both users and policymakers while protecting privacy. The project also aims to gain a broader understanding of privacy and decision making in extreme situations and learn how humans value their privacy and the choices they make in such situations. The project will enable the collection of real-time data, which is not available otherwise, and will enable a more effective response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The increased dissemination of localized information to users can help encourage social distancing from a psychological perspective and thus contribute to the well-being of individuals in society. The improved understanding of privacy from a socio-cognitive perspective to be gained from this project will improve the quality of data privacy solutions that are developed in the future.<br/> <br/>The project will develop a crowdsensing tool that will use self-reported symptoms to effectively identify new clusters of COVID-19 and measure their growth in real-time. Within the project effort, the investigators will study both mathematical guarantees of privacy and the social aspects of privacy decision making, specific to this context. To provide privacy protection for users an appropriate definition of privacy that relaxes differential privacy and corresponding privacy mechanisms will be developed. The project will utilize insights from extant literature to enable users to make an informed decision regarding sharing their private information and also generate new knowledge regarding human privacy behavior in extreme health scenarios. The project also creates a research infrastructure to support and study important questions regarding privacy and public health, and develops new synergies by bringing together experts from privacy, crowdsensing, communication, and epidemiology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

        "abstractText": "This project develops and uses mathematical models and computational methods to study human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection dynamics under conditioning of drugs of abuse.  Drug-addicted HIV patients often suffer from enhanced HIV-associated pathogenic consequences, such as reduced host defenses against infection and development of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND).  Despite being a critical problem for both science and society, the HIV infection dynamics in the context of drug abuse currently remains one of the least understood areas of HIV biology.  In the absence of such knowledge, the ability to devise effective strategies to properly manage the virus infection under drug-abuse conditioning remains one of the biggest challenging efforts.  In this project, mathematical and computational models are developed to study HIV dynamics in the circulation and in the brain under drug-abuse conditioning, such as the presence of morphine within the host.  Further complex models are developed to study the effects of pharmacodynamic properties of morphine on HIV infection in the circulation and in the brain.  The developed models are also used for formulating optimal control problems in order to identify ideal antiretroviral treatment as pre-exposure prophylaxis for HIV-infected drug abusers.  In addition to improving our current knowledge of HIV dynamics, pathogenesis and development of HAND under conditioning of drugs of abuse, this research endures a significant positive and practical impact on developing therapies and vaccines to control the burden of HIV among drug abusers.   <br/><br/>This project produces autonomous models of the HIV dynamics under conditioning of drugs of abuse in the circulation and in the brain, as well as nonautonomous models incorporating the effects of pharmacodynamic properties of drugs of abuse on HIV infection dynamics.  The models are parameterized using experimental data from simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infections of morphine-addicted macaques (animal model of HIV).  The developed models are extensively analyzed using the tools of mathematical modeling, dynamical systems theory, bifurcation theory, asymptotic analysis, theory of periodic systems, stability and persistence theory, as well as statistical and numerical methods. Mathematical challenges anticipated in this research offer opportunities to develop new mathematical theories that advance the field of applied differential equations and optimal control theory.  Results, including optimal antiretroviral therapy treatment protocols, help healthcare professionals to mitigate burdens from HIV infection and HAND in drug abusers, thereby, providing the quality of life to drug-addicted HIV infected patients and their families.  In addition, this project provides extensive interdisciplinary collaborative research training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students from mathematics and biology departments, as well as the School of Pharmacy at University of Missouri-Kansas City (UMKC).  The research opportunities will be especially extended to a variety of undergraduate research programs that place priority on involving underrepresented students, particularly, undergraduate rural students from Missouri and Kansas.

        "title": "Collaborative Research: Dynamics of surfactant - amyloid-beta protein interactions during self-assembly",
        "abstractText": "Clumping of protein molecules in a process called \"aggregation\" is a common problem in cellular biology. One kind of protein aggregation leads to a specific structure of the clumps called \"amyloids\" and is thought to play a key role in many neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease. Recently, protein amyloids have also been associated with normal cellular functions.  A wide variety of aggregate structures are formed during aggregation, and many of these cause a specific biological response.  Hence, understanding the mechanisms of aggregation is critical for human health.  Amyloid formation is influenced by biological surfactant molecules, which associate many amyloid proteins.  In the proposed project, the principal investigator along with a team of collaborators will use experiments, computer simulations, and mathematical analysis to understand how surfactants modulate amyloid protein aggregation to form specific aggregate species. This will transform our understanding of these interactions which play a role in Alzheimer's disease. This scientific endeavor will also involve many students, who will not only learn new areas of research but will also contribute towards data collection and interpretation of results.<br/><br/>Self-association of a protein called amyloid beta, associated with Alzheimer's disease, involves the conversion from its intrinsically disordered, monomeric form to well-organized, fibrillar structures in a nucleation-dependent manner. Among the aggregates formed, the low-molecular weight oligomers have emerged to be physiologically important species. The oligomers formed need not be the obligate intermediates of the fibril formation pathway, and they could be formed along alternate \"off-pathways\", which result in many distinct structural strains of amyloid beta. Many factors can induce off-pathway products.  Among these factors, interfaces generated by biological surfactants (SAs) are physiologically relevant due to their perpetual association with amyloid beta. Recent findings from the principle investigator's lab indicate that non-esterified fatty acid SAs induce off- or on- pathway aggregates in a concentration dependent manner. The investigators hypothesize that concentration-dependent phase transitions of SAs modulate amyloid beta aggregation pathways to generate distinct oligomers. In this work, a collaborative team will test the hypothesis with two specific aims: Aim 1 will investigate biophysically the interactions between amyloid beta and SAs using a variety of anionic SAs, and Aim 2 will model temporal evolution of oligomers as a result of amyloid beta-SA interactions using numerical simulations and reduced order mathematical analysis. An interdisciplinary approach involving experimental biophysics, simulation and mathematical analysis with a synergistic feedback between the experiments (Aim 1) and simulations (Aim 2) will provide insights into the heterotypic interactions between amyloid beta and SAs and will bridge the existing knowledge gap in the field. Considering that the functional effects of off-pathway aggregates are related to their respective morphologies, understanding the physiochemical properties of amyloid beta-SA interactions will be of paramount significance in deciphering amyloid-related cellular processes. This work will also help in a better understanding of aggregation pathways in a larger, more complex network of reactions involving amyloids, which can then be utilized to design intervention strategies in the future. The proposed project will have broader impacts on science and education for undergraduate and graduate students from the three institutions of University of Southern Mississippi (USM), Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU), and Montclair State University (MSU) spanning the areas of molecular biophysics, computational systems biology and mathematical biology respectively.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Networked multi-agent systems are useful in many application domains, including distributed robotics, sensor networks, and smart grids. Due to their many potential applications, networked multi-agent systems have been a focus of intense research activity over the past several decades. Much of the past work on networked multi-agent systems assumes that the agents, and network links over which they communicate, are both reliable. In practical multi-agent systems, some of the system components may fail or may be compromised by an adversary. Faulty agents may behave incorrectly or in an adversarial manner, and similarly, faulty or compromised network links may deliver messages incorrectly. This project addresses the design and analysis of distributed algorithms for multi-agent systems that are robust to adversarial behavior of agents and links, which may result from failures or attacks. The project focusses on two important classes of problems in multi-agent systems, namely, distributed optimization and distributed hypothesis testing. Robust solutions to these problems may be used to obtain robust solutions to other related problems in multi-agent systems. Thus, the project has the potential to yield solutions that improve robustness of practical multi-agent systems. The project scope includes design of robust algorithms, their theoretical analysis, as well as development of a software tool to evaluate these algorithms. The educational component of the project includes participation of undergraduate and graduate students in project activities, and incorporation of project research outcomes into a related graduate course.<br/><br/>The project aims to develop multi-agent algorithms that can tolerate Byzantine failures. The Byzantine fault model captures arbitrary behavior that may be exhibited by faulty or compromised agents or links. A Byzantine faulty agent may be adversarial in nature, and may behave arbitrarily. Possible misbehaviors of a faulty agent include performing computations incorrectly, and sending incorrect or inconsistent messages to other agents. Similarly, a Byzantine faulty link can result in tampering of messages sent over the link. Multi-agent algorithms that can tolerate Byzantine failures are also robust in presence of a wide range of faulty behaviors possible in a practical system. In the context of multi-agent optimization and multi-agent hypothesis testing, the project explores many research challenges, including the following: (i) identifying network properties that are necessary and sufficient to tolerate Byzantine agent or link failures, while achieving desirable properties for the distributed computation, (ii) evaluating the impact of multi-hop forwarding of messages on the multi-agent computation, (iii) mechanisms for network adaptation to improve performance, and (iv) analysis of algorithm behavior in large-scale networks.  Through the work on these issues, the project aims to develop fundamental principles that can guide the design of robust fault-tolerant algorithms for different types of distributed computations. The tools used for evaluating the algorithms include mathematical analysis as well as simulation-based experimentation.",

        "abstractText": "The growing ubiquity of smartphones, combined with the rapid improvement of operating system support for direct wireless communication between nearby devices, creates a compelling opportunity for the emergence of easy to deploy and widely used smartphone peer-to-peer applications. There are several use cases for such applications. For example, in many user environments, cellular data minutes are bought in small blocks and carefully conserved by users, generating an interest in networking operations that can avoid infrastructure.  In addition, smartphone peer-to-peer networks can bring connectivity to settings such as disaster zones, festivals, or wilderness where traditional cellular and WiFi coverage is compromised, overwhelmed, or non-existent. This project aims to develop network algorithms and tools that simplify the design of useful distributed systems on top of local peer-to-peer connections. The project has the potential for significant societal impact by enabling compelling new applications for smartphone peer-to-peer networks. The project is also expected to have significant educational impact.<br/> <br/>The project focuses on designing and analyzing provably correct and efficient network computation algorithms that can run on top of existing smartphone peer-to-peer services, and simplify the design of peer-to-peer systems that can be deployed on existing smartphone hardware. The project consists of two major research directions. The first research direction is experimental in nature. It will study and evaluate peer-to-peer services available in commodity smartphone operating systems and define a small number of validated abstractions that capture their capabilities and behavior. The second research direction is theoretical in nature. It will describe and analyze solutions to well-motivated network computation primitives using these abstractions. The problems studied will include consensus, leader election, rumor spreading, gossip and function computation. The project will seek both provably correct and efficient algorithms as well as lower bounds that establish fundamental limits for useful computation in this setting.",

        "abstractText": "This award supports the development, construction, and commissioning of an optical microscope capable of imaging individual atoms that are captured inside a thin film of frozen neon. Initially, this single atom microscope will capture and count the number of magnesium atoms produced in collisions of neon and helium atoms.  Detailed measurements of these rare collisions will help explain the origin and abundance of copper, silver, and other heavy chemical elements.  Because the single atom microscope will increase the sensitivity of these types of measurements by at least a factor of one hundred, laboratory experiments that mimic the conditions inside of stars where these elements are produced will be possible for the first time.  In parallel, the PI will develop a modular planetarium program that describes how the chemical elements are formed inside of stars. These modules will be presented within the context of a virtual tour of the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory, which emphasizes how research being conducted at the Lab impacts our understanding of this process and how this research is beneficial to society.<br/><br/><br/>The primary research goal of this project is to develop and commission a single atom microscope for measuring rare nuclear reactions that are relevant for nuclear astrophysics. The recoil products will be captured within the noble gas solid and then optically detected using resonant laser excitation and single photon detectors. A single atom microscope designed for magnesium, when coupled with a recoil separator, would allow for measurements of neon-helium nuclear fusion reactions with at least a hundred fold improvement in sensitivity.  These reactions play a key role in the production of neutrons that drives the slow neutron capture process (s-process) inside of massive stars, which is responsible for the creation of about half of the heavy elements between mass 60 and 90 including copper and silver.  Steps for this project include demonstrating optical single atom detection of ytterbium in solid neon, calibrating the efficiency, sensitivity, and selectivity of the technique, and finally building and commissioning a single atom microscope for measuring the nuclear reactions that produce magnesium atoms. Critical steps include a detailed understanding of the optical backgrounds produced by impurities in the various optical components, optical spectroscopy of ytterbium and magnesium in solid noble gases, and the design of a high light collection efficiency diffraction-limited optical imaging system.",

        "abstractText": "Social networks provide many benefits, but also give rise to serious concerns regarding privacy. Indeed, since privacy protections are not intrinsically incorporated into the underlying technological framework, user data is still accessible to the social network and is open to misuse. While there have been efforts to incorporate privacy into social networks, existing solutions are not sufficiently lightweight, transparent, and functional, and therefore have achieved only limited adoption. This project develops a privacy-preserving social network (Trusted-Space) where user data are protected from the social network itself, other social network users, and advertisers. The project synthesizes solutions from a technological and sociological perspective to ensure that all of the required functionalities for both users and advertisers to participate effectively in the social network are available. The project develops compact data representations and usability driven functionalities that are privacy-preserving. The project also evaluates people's expectations about the implications of their own actions on their privacy and the future behavior of the algorithms, towards creating a simple, transparent, and predictable environment to facilitate widespread adoption. <br/><br/>Since social networks permeate modern life, the project will have significant impact through enabling the incorporation of usable privacy technology into the social network fabric. The project also cultivates the integration of research and education, by providing opportunities for research to undergraduates and graduates, while increasing the awareness of privacy issues among the general public through outreach activities.",

        "abstractText": "This project develops and uses mathematical models and computational methods to study human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection dynamics under conditioning of drugs of abuse.  Drug-addicted HIV patients often suffer from enhanced HIV-associated pathogenic consequences, such as reduced host defenses against infection and development of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND).  Despite being a critical problem for both science and society, the HIV infection dynamics in the context of drug abuse currently remains one of the least understood areas of HIV biology.  In the absence of such knowledge, the ability to devise effective strategies to properly manage the virus infection under drug-abuse conditioning remains one of the biggest challenging efforts.  In this project, mathematical and computational models are developed to study HIV dynamics in the circulation and in the brain under drug-abuse conditioning, such as the presence of morphine within the host.  Further complex models are developed to study the effects of pharmacodynamic properties of morphine on HIV infection in the circulation and in the brain.  The developed models are also used for formulating optimal control problems in order to identify ideal antiretroviral treatment as pre-exposure prophylaxis for HIV-infected drug abusers.  In addition to improving our current knowledge of HIV dynamics, pathogenesis and development of HAND under conditioning of drugs of abuse, this research endures a significant positive and practical impact on developing therapies and vaccines to control the burden of HIV among drug abusers.   <br/><br/>This project produces autonomous models of the HIV dynamics under conditioning of drugs of abuse in the circulation and in the brain, as well as nonautonomous models incorporating the effects of pharmacodynamic properties of drugs of abuse on HIV infection dynamics.  The models are parameterized using experimental data from simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infections of morphine-addicted macaques (animal model of HIV).  The developed models are extensively analyzed using the tools of mathematical modeling, dynamical systems theory, bifurcation theory, asymptotic analysis, theory of periodic systems, stability and persistence theory, as well as statistical and numerical methods. Mathematical challenges anticipated in this research offer opportunities to develop new mathematical theories that advance the field of applied differential equations and optimal control theory.  Results, including optimal antiretroviral therapy treatment protocols, help healthcare professionals to mitigate burdens from HIV infection and HAND in drug abusers, thereby, providing the quality of life to drug-addicted HIV infected patients and their families.  In addition, this project provides extensive interdisciplinary collaborative research training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students from mathematics and biology departments, as well as the School of Pharmacy at University of Missouri-Kansas City (UMKC).  The research opportunities will be especially extended to a variety of undergraduate research programs that place priority on involving underrepresented students, particularly, undergraduate rural students from Missouri and Kansas.

Networked multi-agent systems are useful in many application domains, including distributed robotics, sensor networks, and smart grids. Due to their many potential applications, networked multi-agent systems have been a focus of intense research activity over the past several decades. Much of the past work on networked multi-agent systems assumes that the agents, and network links over which they communicate, are both reliable.

That is, malnutrition and obesity might co-exist within a particular society. This dissertation research will collect body measurements and biomarker data to investigate whether outcomes on the extremes of nutritional spectrum co-exist together and at what units of analysis.  Specifically, the investigator will study nutritional and health outcomes and their causes at finer spatial scales and link these individual outcomes to household and background factors that contribute to health.  The project takes advantage of existing longitudinal data from the mid-1990s, and ongoing fieldwork that tracks demographic and social changes. This project will also looks at early-life and other influences on health. Thus, prospective and retrospective data will be analyzed to determine early-life factors that might affect current nutritional outcomes. The literature on the nutrition transition has focused on trends at the country or region-level. The dual burden of undernutrition and over nutrition is one feature of this nutritional transition. <br/><br/>Lower and Middle Income (LMICs) countries are now also experiencing spatial and urban transformations, changes in food production, globalization and increasing social inequalities that are pinpointed as factors responsible for shifts in nutritional outcomes and towards increased diet-related Non-communicable Diseases (NCDs). The social, and not necessarily economic, roots of this shift has allowed \"epidemics\" of over nutrition and related chronic NCDs to extend beyond high-income countries to those usually classified as developing countries. The public-health- interpretation often presents a linear theory of this societal transformation. This project takes a sociologically informed view, which recognizes that the social processes driving these shifts are unevenly distributed. It focuses more on the micro processes within the community and household that might result in heterogeneous consequences like extreme nutritional outcomes, now referred to as the dual burden. This dual burden phenomenon allows a possibility where undernutrition and over nutrition might represent different facets of deprivation. The high and continued prevalence of undernutrition at early ages does not negate the possibility of later-life problems of over nutrition. The related burden of NCDs for South Asia, the region being studied, has risen at a rate exceeding global rates. The dual nutritional status burden examined in this project has a potential impact on national healthcare policy, international aid objectives and more. Thus, the detection and determinants of such a dual burden is a concern for both individuals and communities.  The study builds on collaboration with an existing research site in Nepal, the Chitwan Valley Family Study (CVFS).",

Annual assessments, facilitated by an external evaluator, will measure scholar graduation rates and will also inform changes that may need to be made in OSA's design during implementation. Lessons learned and effective practices that emerge from the program evaluation data will be disseminated to the STEM education community and help enlarge the knowledge base regarding attributes and practices of successful scholarship programs of this type.",

        "abstractText": "Big data analytics can revolutionize innovation and productivity across diverse domains. However, this requires sharing or joint analysis of data, which is often inhibited due to privacy and security concerns. While techniques have been developed to enable the safe use of data for analysis, none of these work for the critical task of outlier detection. Outlier detection is one of the most fundamental data analysis tasks, useful in applications as far ranging as homeland security, to medical informatics, to financial fraud. However, when the data is fragmented and cannot be collected together, it is impossible even to appropriately identify outliers, much less explain them. This project aims to fill this gap, and enable the secure identification and explanation of outliers without breaching the privacy of the data owners, the data custodians, or the data subjects. The potential to advance science through the discovery and analysis of exceptions can have unparalleled impact and significantly help in widening co-operation, thus preventing loss through data isolation.<br/><br/>The project develops strong definitions for private outlier detection encompassing both process privacy and result privacy. A suite of privacy-preserving tools and techniques are then developed to enable outlier detection across different data ownership models, over a variety of multi-modal datasets, while supporting differing tradeoffs of privacy, efficiency, and utility. The research improves our scientific understanding of secure computation, data outsourcing and distributed data analysis. The project also cultivates the integration of research and education, by providing opportunities for research by undergraduates at an early stage.",

        "abstractText": "Wireless networks have current and future applications in many domains, including emergency response and rescue, monitoring and surveillance, distributed sensing, swarm robotics, and smart grids. In such distributed systems, wireless networks are useful to allow the different agents in the system to communicate and jointly coordinate their activities. This project investigates design of efficient algorithms for implementing the distributed primitives while taking into account the properties of the communication network. Coordination primitives of interest include consensus, fault-tolerant broadcast, and distributed optimization. For instance, the consensus primitive allows the different agents to agree on a common course of action, as a function of potentially different actions suggested by different agents. <br/><br/>The scope of this project is at the intersection of communication and computing. The project investigates the impact of wireless network characteristics such as error-prone links, dynamic topology, broadcast medium, and capacity constraints, on the design and performance of algorithms for important distributed computation problems. Two classes of algorithms are of interest, namely, iterative algorithms and unconstrained algorithms. Iterative algorithms have a simple iterative structure, and they maintain a small amount of state and require only limited information about the underlying network topology. Unconstrained algorithms utilize more information about the network, and can achieve better performance. Thus, iterative and unconstrained algorithms achieve different trade-offs between complexity and performance. The goals of the project include investigation of the impact of topology control, resource management, and dynamic adaptation on the performance of the distributed algorithms. The project will improve the understanding of how robust distributed algorithms can be designed for practical wireless networks. The project will involve undergraduate and graduate students. The students will gain valuable experience working on distributed computing problems that are relevant in a variety of applications.",

Today's key-value/NoSQL storage systems lie at different points on the tradeoff spectrum of availability (i.e., fast reads and writes) vs. data consistency (across multiple clients) vs. partition-tolerance. This project will better characterize what is achievable along this spectrum, to make these systems dynamically adapt along the spectrum to meet application requirements, and to benchmark the actual availability and consistency achieved by real systems under real conditions.<br/><br/>The project will follow two synergistic thrusts. The first thrust will use probabilistic models for availability, consistency, and partitions to analyze the tradeoffs among these. Then it will design adaptive techniques to meet an SLA (Service Level Agreement) or SLO (Service Level Objective) which specifies either an availability constraint or a consistency constraint, while optimizing the other metric. Finally, these techniques will be implemented in some of the leading key-value/NoSQL storage systems in use today in industry. Our second thrust will apply the large body of formal verification research to key-value/NoSQL systems. The work herein includes use of a formal modeling language to specify models for key-value/NoSQL stores, and use of standard as well as statistical model-checking to analyze and characterize the behavior of these systems.<br/><br/>This work will imbue existing key-value/NoSQL storage systems with the ability to adapt to the tradeoffs between consistency, availability, and partition-tolerance, as a function of provider and customer requirements, at run-time. It will lead to better SLAs and SLOs that combine both consistency models and availability models in a practical and achievable way. Thus, the project will directly impact the large developer and user communities of key-value/NoSQL storage systems. The project will produce open software and meaningful datasets.",

This includes data about individual's characteristics as well as their connections and interactions. Many real-world applications have complex group dynamics involving multiple people. The analysis of such group interactions has the potential to revolutionize social sciences, business, and commerce domains. The goal of this project is to develop a novel computational framework to support scalable analysis of group dynamics in large social networks.  The key idea is to explicitly model groups of individuals rather than simply capturing links between pairs of individuals. The broader impacts of this project will consist of enabling richer analysis of complex interactions in real-world networks. It will also enhance the University of Minnesota Computer Science curriculum through courses and research experiences with synergy between the areas of computer systems and data mining.<br/><br/>To model group interactions in networks, this project will use hypergraphs, a generalization of graphs, where hyperedges represent relations between one or more entities. Hypergraphs have the potential to provide higher modeling accuracy for many group phenomena, as well as higher storage and computational efficiency, compared to their graph counterparts.  This project will develop an analysis framework called MESH: Minnesota Engine for Scalable evolving Hypergraph analysis, that will provide algorithms and system components to support scalable analysis of evolving hypergraphs. The MESH algorithms will be designed to model and compute several common data-driven questions related to group dynamics in real-world networks. The MESH system-level techniques will be designed to support the execution of these algorithms in a distributed and scalable manner.<br/><br/>For further information see the project web site at:  http://mesh.cs.umn.edu",

To address these needs, the Philadelphia Regional Noyce Partnership (PRNP) consisting of Bryn Mawr and Haverford Colleges, Drexel University, La Salle University, the University of Pennsylvania, Saint Joseph's University and Temple University, together with the Philadelphia Education Fund and its Philadelphia Teacher Residency Program will develop a new teacher support program that will provide flexible, individualized supportive services to new first and second year Noyce teachers so as to increase their persistence and professional growth as STEM professionals in the Philadelphia region. The Philadelphia Regional Noyce Partnership will develop a model of early career teacher support using regional resources that will retain and sustain new STEM teachers.  These new Noyce teachers will have increased opportunities to participate in mentoring, professional development, communities of practice and social networks with regional STEM professionals in real and virtual environments. The new teacher support model will include the following components: (1) Individualized Support Plan (ISP); (2) Mentoring (Mentor Training Model Development, Mentor Training and Mentoring Support); (3) Professional Development; (4) Outreach and Networking; and (5) Website Based Resources and Communication.<br/><br/>The proposed activities will contribute to the subfield within STEM education focused on preparing,retaining, and supporting the development of high quality teachers in high needs settings. Specifically, through developing and testing an approach that supports both new teachers' emotional well-being and their instructional outlook and skills, the project will increase understanding of the challenges confronted by novice teachers in a large urban school district and ways that those challenges can be managed and met. By the end of the two-year project, there will be a refined regional model of new STEM teacher support that can be scaled to provide support for large numbers of new teachers. In addition to providing support for new STEM teachers working in high-needs schools in Philadelphia, to  increase their capacities as teachers and the likelihood that they will stay in teaching, the project will prepare experienced STEM teachers to serve as mentors of new teachers, enhancing the self-sustaining capacity of the network of teachers in Philadelphia. The project will strengthen a growing partnership across seven teacher education institutions in Philadelphia, facilitating regional cooperation efforts devoted to teacher development and support. Finally, through collaborative efforts, the partnership will offer a rich menu of supports for all new STEM teachers in the region, exceeding the capacity of any single institution to support its graduates.",

        "abstractText": "The objective of this proposal is to develop a distributed algorithmic framework, supported by a highly fault-tolerant software system, for executing critical transmission-level operations of the North American power grid using gigantic volumes of Synchrophasor data. As the number of Phasor Measurement Units (PMU) increases to more than thousands in the next 4-5 years, it is rather intuitive that the current state-of-the-art centralized communication and information processing architecture of Wide-Area Measurement System (WAMS) will no longer be sustainable under such data-explosion, and a completely distributed cyber-physical architecture will need to be developed. The North American Synchrophasor Initiative (NASPI) is currently addressing this architectural aspect by developing new communication and computing protocols through NASPI-net and Phasor Gateway. However, very little attention has been paid so far to perhaps the most critical consequence of this envisioned distributed architecture \"namely\", distributed algorithms, and their relevant middleware. Our primary task, therefore, will be to develop parallel computational methods for solving real-time wide-area monitoring and control problems with analytical investigation of their stability, convergence and robustness properties, followed by their implementation and testing against extraneous malicious attacks using our WAMS-RTDS testbed at NC State. In particular, we will address three critical research problems \"namely\" distributed wide-area oscillation monitoring, transient stability assessment, and voltage stability monitoring.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this research will be in establishing an extremely timely application area of the PMU technology through its integration with distributed computing and optimal control. It will illustrate how ideas from advanced ideas from numerical methods and distributed optimization can be combined into power system monitoring and control applications, and how they can be implemented via fault-tolerant computing to maintain grid stability in face of catastrophic cyber and physical disturbances.<br/><br/>The broader impact of this project will be in providing a much-needed application of CPS engineering  to advance emerging research on PMU-integrated next-generation smart grids. Research results will be broadcast through journal publications, jointly organized graduate courses between NC State and University of Illinois Urbana Champagne, conference tutorials and workshops. Undergraduate research for minority engineering students will be promoted via the FREEDM Systems Center, summer internships via Information Trust Institute (UIUC) and RENCI, and middle/high-school student mentoring through the NCSU Science House program.",

The goal of this project is to develop a unified system-theoretic framework and analytical tools for cyber-physical security of power systems, capturing the dynamics of the physical system as well as that of the cyber system. Research tasks include: 1) Development of a methodology for impact analysis that includes systematic identification of worst-case stealthy attacks on the power system's wide-area control and evaluating the resulting consequences in terms of stability violations and performance loss. 2) Development of robust cyber-physical countermeasures, employing a combination of methods from system theory, cyber security, and model-based/data-driven tools, in the form of domain-specific anomaly detection/tolerance algorithms and attack-resilient control algorithms. 3) Evaluating the effectiveness of the proposed impact modeling and mitigation algorithms through a combination of simulation and testbed-based evaluations, using realistic system topologies and attack scenarios. The project makes significant contributions to enhance the security and resiliency of the power grid and lays a scientific foundation for cyber-physical security of critical infrastructure.

        "abstractText": "This research project will develop a theoretical and computational framework to understand and enable the socio-technical dynamics shaping the assembly of teams in distributed global contexts. The main barrier to understanding and explaining the role of human centered computing in team assembly is finding a suitable research environment where (1) geographically distributed individuals from potentially different cultures are assembling in teams of varying sizes to accomplish a variety of tasks over varying durations; (2) their actions, interactions and transactions are captured with precise time-stamps; and (3) their outcomes would be recorded with well-defined metrics. Massively multiplayer online role-playing games offer a research environment that meets all of these requirements. EVE Online, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game, offers a potentially suitable research opportunity to study the assembly of teams and ecosystems of teams. It is notable for allowing as many as tens of thousands of people to interact simultaneously on a single server cluster, from around the world, through a well-developed economic system and serious long-term coalitions, in a more flexible action framework than many other popular games possess. <br/><br/>This high-risk high-payoff project will explore the feasibility of using data from EVE Online to identify the socio-technical and cultural mechanisms that explain the assembly of teams more generally. If successful, the study will serve as a model for larger scale studies that, in addition to identifying the assembly mechanisms also assess the impact of these mechanisms on the performance of global teams. The most important and complex decisions in society are made in teams. And yet, assembling effective teams is a daunting task. While there is an awareness of how team collaborations can spearhead socio-economic change, we still have sparse sociotechnical knowledge of how globally distributed cross-cultural teams and systems of teams are assembled. This project seeks to address this limitation. First, the proposed research offers the promise to launch a new generation of theorizing and research on the assembly mechanisms of teams and ecosystem of teams. The empirical data that will be used to develop and test these theories will be a high risk effort but with potential for unprecedented scale, size, and completeness. Second, the research will arguably be the first effort in the field of social networks to develop hypergraph techniques to study assembly of teams and ecosystems of teams. <br/><br/>The knowledge and tools developed in this research will allow practitioners to cultivate more effectively the emergence and performance of ad hoc teams in business, science and gaming.

The theoretical discovery of this proposal is motivated with regard to its application to the electric power grid, for the computation of stability margin and for online transient stability analysis in power systems.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: The proposed research is in the unification and development of methods and tools from the ergodic theory of dynamical systems and control approaches for the purpose of its application to network controlled dynamical systems with uncertainty. The distinctive feature of our proposed approach is that it treats several aspects of uncertainty amplification specific to networked systems in a unified way. Namely, it allows us to handle the uncertainty of the communication links, the uncertainty in the system interactions, and the uncertainty in the networked system evolution. This unified framework has allowed the PI to make two fundamental contributions for the analysis and control of uncertain nonlinear systems over networks. The first contribution is in the use of ergodic theory-based framework to provide linear programming-based analytical and computational solution for stability verification and control design of complex nonequilibrium dynamics in nonlinear system. The second contribution arises in the derivation of fundamental limitation results for the stabilization and observation of nonlinear systems with uncertainty at the input and output channels. The PI propose to further extend these methods to discover analytical methods and computational tools for the analysis and control of network controlled dynamical systems with particular focus on addressing two main challenges, namely uncertainty and self-emergent nonequilibrium dynamics in the network systems.<br/><br/>Broader Impact: The theoretical and computational tools developed in the proposal have applications in the emerging areas of network systems, including biological and social networks. Our results on identification of feedback mechanisms for the emergence of complex nonequilibrium dynamics in network systems can be applied to biological networks to help understand the consequence of genetic modification, and for guiding experiments design for modifying such behavior. For social networks such as disease spread, the proposed uncertainty-based modeling framework and theoretical research can be used to provide conditions for the prevention or spread of an epidemic. The interdisciplinary nature of this project will provide ample opportunities to train graduate students in leading-edge research that cuts across multiple disciplines.

The project has the potential for broad national impact as a model that could be adapted by other STEM teacher preparation consortia around the country. <br/><br/>The PRN Partnership is developing Asset Mapping and Needs Assessment of the region's STEM teacher preparation programs, is using these data in a year-long planning process, and is pilot testing a variety of initiatives that bring together the partners' Noyce educators, representing all stages of the STEM teacher continuum, to learn from one another in a community of practice.<br/><br/>The development of the partnership is inspired by theories of social network analysis which suggest that positive and unexpected synergies will occur and social capital will increase when trusted relationships are built between previously unconnected individuals and organizations.",

        "abstractText": "Deployment of wireless local area networks (WLAN) has undergone dramatic growth in recent years. Multiple WLAN standards have been developed, including several versions of IEEE 802.11. The widespread deployment of IEEE 802.11 is based on the Distributed Coordination Function (DCF) component of the standard, which incorporates channel contention resolution using CSMA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access). However, an important shortcoming of past deployments of CSMA-based protocols has been their inability to achieve optimal performance.  In recent years, researchers have developed new throughput-optimal CSMA algorithms. These results have opened up the possibility of designing CSMA-based protocols that can perform close to the optimal. However, the prior work on throughput-optimal CSMA makes several simplifying assumptions, including assumptions of perfect carrier sensing, symmetric interference relationship between links, and fixed rate transmissions. <br/><br/>The thrust of this project is on developing CSMA-based scheduling mechanisms that can work well in practical networks. Towards this goal, the project investigates systematic relaxation of unrealistic assumptions and constraints, and attempts to develop CSMA algorithms that can perform well under the relaxed conditions. The scope of the project includes implementation of selected protocols on an experimental testbed. The project explores CSMA in the context of wireless multi-hop mesh networks, as well as infrastructure-based wireless LANs. Expected results from the project include new theoretical algorithms as well as efficient CSMA-based protocols that can perform well in practice.",

Organized by Drexel University, the University of Massachusetts at Boston, and SUNY Cortland, the conferences serve the Noyce Scholarship Program community from over 40 projects in the Northeastern states.  The conferences enable faculty, preservice students and new science and mathematics teachers from Noyce projects to frame a new area of research that provides stronger insights about the learning and achievement of subgroups of students in high need schools who have been historically marginalized in STEM fields. Participants convene to share ideas, best practices and inspire one another to address the national needs of supporting high quality, innovative and transformative mathematics and science teaching and to advance urban and rural education.  The conferences provide opportunities for Noyce scholars and teachers to collaborate, share experiences, expertise and skills with their peers and colleagues and continue to maintain connections after the conference.  The conferences aim to help Noyce Scholars and teachers improve their teaching so as to make gains in closing the achievement gap as they learn about practices that address needs of students in high-need schools. The goal is to transform practices and policies to better support science and mathematics learning for students in high-need schools. Conference participants are contributing to the development of a web-based platform designed to address the challenges of STEM education and STEM teaching in high-need urban and rural schools.",

        "title": "Fundamental limitations and complex dynamics in nonlinear network systems with uncertainty",
        "abstractText": "The objective of this proposal is to discover and understand the fundamental limitations on the stability and estimation performance of nonlinear network system with uncertainty. Network systems with uncertainty, such as the power grid, Internet, gene regulatory networks, and communication networks are ubiquitous in science and engineering. The various sources of uncertainty include uncertainty in system parameters, interconnection, channel delays and drop-outs, and external noise. In spite of their ubiquitous presence, there is very little understanding and a lack of systematic analysis and design tools for building robust networks systems. The situation of network systems consisting of nonlinear elements is further complicated because of the possibility of self-emergent behavior in the form of complex non-equilibrium dynamics. The proposed research in this proposal will help us understand the fundamental limitations in the design of such network systems with uncertainty.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: The methods and tools to be developed in this proposal for the analysis of nonlinear network systems with uncertainty are inspired from the ergodic theory of random dynamical systems. The transformative idea of this proposal is in the extension and development of methods and tools from ergodic theory of random dynamical system to random control dynamical system for the purpose of understanding the fundamental performance limitations in the estimation and control of nonlinear network control systems with uncertainty. The extended formalism has lead to the new results on the fundamental performance limitations on nonlinear stabilization with uncertainty. The main highlight of the new results is that it point to the important role-played by the global nonequilibrium dynamics of nonlinear systems in obtaining performance limitations on stabilization. The global nature of this new result make them fundamentally different than the existing performance limitation results on nonlinear stabilization without uncertainty, where the limitations are expressed in terms of the local eigenvalues of the linearization. The proposed research on fundamental performance limitations in nonlinear estimation with uncertainty is motivated from the applied problem of interest of building a robust surveillance network with limited sensor resources. This problem is of applied interest to United Technologies Company and the PI is collaborating with United Technologies Research Center (UTRC) on this problem. Furthermore the developed ergodic theory-based formalism for random control dynamical systems will also be used to explain emergence of complex dynamics that arise due to link failures and uncertainty in interconnection, in the nonlinear network control system.<br/><br/>Broader Impact: The results on the emergence of complex dynamics due to uncertainty will help predict the instabilities and failures of the network systems. The research collaboration with UTRC, will provide opportunity to graduate students to work on research problems of industry interest and spend time at industry. This collaboration will also lead to exchange of know-how between academia and industry and vice versa. The interdisciplinary nature of this project will provide ample opportunities to train graduate students in leading edge research that cuts across multiple disciplines.",

        "title": "EAGER: Network-Constrained Distributed Primitives",
        "abstractText": "Distributed applications require coordination between multiple nodes in a network, and they need to continue to operate correctly despite node failures.  Implementation of such applications benefits from the availability of distributed primitives for commonly used distributed operations, such as clock synchronization or consensus. While most of the past distributed applications have traditionally used wired networks, there is an emerging trend towards the use of wireless networks for distributed applications.<br/><br/>The focus of this interdisciplinary project is on design, analysis and implementation of distributed primitives for wireless networks. In wireless networks, the network capacity is often quite limited.  This project explores the design of efficient algorithms for distributed primitives under network capacity constraints, while exploiting wireless network capabilities such as local broadcast and physical layer adaptation. The scope of the project includes network-constrained distributed primitives for synchronization, consensus and function computation.  Expected results from the project include theoretical bounds on performance of distributed primitives under network capacity constraints, design of efficient algorithms for the primitives, and practical implementations based on insights gained from the theory. Outcomes from the project are expected to allow efficient implementation of future distributed applications in resource-constrained wireless networks. The project brings together networking and distributed systems viewpoints, and is expected to yield fundamental new insights of interest to both areas. The research outcomes from this project will be disseminated via publications in technical conferences and journals, and incorporated into distributed computing and wireless networking courses.",

        "abstractText": "<br/>The objective of this research is to bring high levels of system reliability and integrity to application domains that cannot afford the cost, power, weight, and size associated with physical redundancy.  The approach is to develop complementary monitoring algorithms and novel computing architectures that enable the detection of faults.  In particular, there is a significant opportunity to reduce the reliance on physical redundancy by combining model-based and data-driven monitoring techniques.  Implementing this approach to fault detection would be difficult with existing software and computing architectures.  This motivates the development of a general purpose monitoring framework through monitoring-aware compilers coupled with enhancements to multi-core architectures.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of the project is twofold.  First, it has the potential to lead to a novel fault detection approach that blends complementary monitoring algorithms.  Second, advances in multi-core processors are leveraged to enable implementation of these fault detection approaches.  This addresses key themes in cyber-physical systems by investigating the fundamental issue of fault detection for physical systems and by developing a generic processor architecture for monitoring.<br/><br/>With respect to broader impact, project offers the potential for positive influences on industrial practice and education.  If successful, the design ideas from this project can be incorporated into low-cost multi-core architectures suitable for embedded systems.  The potentially transformative performance improvement offered by this framework could also impact current research in run-time verification and on-line monitoring.

This creates a serious privacy problem which often inhibits the use of this data. This project explores the problem of performing optimization analysis over distributed data without conflicting with privacy and security concerns. This is especially challenging due to the complexity and iterative nature of the solutions. An inherent aim is to also solve some of the fundamental problems underlying privacy-preserving analysis / secure computation and make it more accessible and applicable. Some of the innovative expected results include: (1) novel formulations of security definitions that are more relaxed than the traditional definitions yet still model the real security concerns; (2) new algorithms, computational complexity results, and tools for specific widely used optimization problems; (3) a more generalized view of privacy; (4) game theoretic interpretations and modeling of the multi-party computation; and (5) result analysis ? a quantification of privacy loss through results. The project will have tremendous broader impact via fundamental research and integrative education. Direct outcomes of the research can significantly help in widening co-operation between organizations and minimize loss through data isolation. This would result in cost savings and new income realization potentially worth billions of dollars through joint resource usage.

        "title": "Collaborative Proposal: DHB Virtual Worlds: An Exploratorium for Theorizing and Modeling the Dynamics of Group Behavior",
        "abstractText": "Abstract <br/>This major inter-disciplinary research effort will use virtual worlds as an exploratorium to theoretically extend and empirically model the dynamics of group behavior. In the process it will develop novel computational techniques for analyzing large-scale networks, which will have applicability across a wide variety of domains. <br/><br/>The most important and complex decisions made by governments and organizations occur in group contexts. A central challenge, spurred by new developments in information technologies (IT), is that the nature of groups and how they operate has changed radically. Today, many groups ? in social, political, and economic contexts - are ad hoc, agile, transient entities that emerge from a larger primordial network of relationships. For a short time, these groups accomplish a variety of tasks, and then they dissolve, only to be reconstituted later with a different configuration. While there is growing awareness of the socio-economic consequences of these groups, our understanding of how they form and their impact on effectiveness is severely limited. <br/><br/>This project will address this limitation by developing a theoretical framework that reflects the contemporary conceptualizations of groups. It proposes a network approach to modeling the eco-system of overlapping and constantly changing groups that constitute the fabric of contemporary society. It recognizes that empirically testing such a model poses formidable data collection challenges. However, a unique resource available to the research team is access to all behavioral traces (server logs) from one of the world''s largest Massively Multiplayer Online (MMO) games, EverQuest 2, which is particularly well-suited to theorize and empirically model the dynamics of group behavior. MMOs comprise tens of thousands of players who are at any one point in time coalescing in thousands of groups to accomplish \"\"\"\"quests\"\"\"\" and \"\"\"\"raids\"\"\"\" that involve a variety of activities similar to tasks we undertake in real life ? finding information or materials, making, selling or buying products and services. <br/><br/>Beyond the data collection challenge, the scale of the proposed research enterprise also poses significant computational challenges in uncovering and analyzing the complexities that govern the dynamics of group behavior in these virtual worlds. Using advanced computing applications and technologies, this project seeks to capture, infer, and model the networks that explain how groups emerge and how they function. Specifically, the researchers will use temporally evolving graphs to model such networks, and develop scalable algorithms to compute metrics of group behavior on them. Tying these complex and shifting individual and networked behaviors to traditional forms of analyses represents a novel interdisciplinary challenge in both scope and complexity. <br/><br/>The project will expand our knowledge of how groups form and operate in larger ecosystems of groups, individuals, and organizations. The analysis of logs generated from Virtual Worlds poses novel challenges from a computational perspective. This interdisciplinary investigation will result in new (1) information models for modeling the Virtual World, (2) data structuring and algorithmic techniques for data access and analysis, and (3) techniques for computational efficiency. <br/><br/>The knowledge and tools developed in this research will allow researchers to understand more fully, and practitioners to cultivate more effectively, the emergence and performance of ad hoc groups in contemporary society. It will also provide other disciplines with new computational and statistical modeling methodologies and tools, which should have considerable positive implications for future research in other disciplinary areas. The findings and deliverables of the proposed research will be immediately generalizable to training and education related to groups (beyond just MMOs or Virtual Worlds), social networks, and online games. <br/> <br/>",

The School District of Philadelphia is partnering with Drexel University to prepare highly qualified teachers to fill current and expected K-12 needs, especially in mathematics and the sciences.  The Noyce program enables 10 science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) undergraduates from Drexel and 15 STEM mid-career professionals from the community to earn the credentials they need to teach mathematics and science in Philadelphia's high-need schools.  These 25 Noyce recipients will be new teachers in addition to the (typically 60) high school teachers produced annually at Drexel, for a roughly 40% increase in production of highly qualified high school teachers in science and mathematics.  Because these schools have large low-income student populations and shortages of highly qualified teachers, the need for high-quality instruction in these subject areas is critical.  The program objectives are to: 1) recruit qualified STEM students and professionals dedicated to teaching in high need urban districts; 2) provide strong preparation addressing content knowledge, pedagogical content knowledge, and technology integration; 3) provide well-designed mentoring and induction to support and retain these teachers in high need urban districts; 4) emphasize recruitment of minorities, and persons with disabilities; 5) instill personal accountability for meeting pedagogy and content knowledge standards for outstanding performance in  the classroom; 6) increase the number of students from partnering schools and at Drexel who may see teaching as a viable career choice for mathematics and science majors.",

        "abstractText": "Rare events occur very infrequently and are thus very difficult to detect. However, when they do occur, their consequences can be quite dramatic quite often in a negative sense. Examples include network intrusions and security breaches, cardiac events, credit card and other types of financial fraud, telecom circuit overloads, and traffic accidents. Timely and accurate detection of rare events is critical. Recent years have seen an explosive growth in the speed of data collection and storage devices. Most organizations collect quantities of data about various processes in their computer systems, at various levels of abstraction, including hardware, operating and communication systems, database query logs, etc. These comprehensive event logs provide a wealth of data, analysis of which has the potential to identify the rare events described earlier. The project includes investigation of the issues in rare class analysis, and development of a suite of techniques to address them. The focus of this project is on supervised learning methods for rare class analysis. Specific tasks include development of novel feature selection schemes and robust predictive models especially suited for rare class problems, and adapting rare class learning algorithms to data streams. The research results will be made publicly available at the project website (http://www.cs.umn.edu/~kumar/rare.html). The techniques developed, as part of this research will be applicable across a wide spectrum of applications in which one is interested in finding those few, unusual, special cases which are highly significant and of potentially very high value.",

        "title": "A Novel Building Material for Panelized Construction",
        "abstractText": "FRP/AC sandwich panel with a core of lightweight high performance Aerated Concrete (AC) (e.g., Autoclave Aerated Concrete, Cellular Concrete etc.) and face sheets of Fiber Reinforced Plastics (FRP) composites has the potential to be an excellent energy absorbing construction material plus it is relatively inexpensive and available over much of the globe. Consistent with the recent interests in high performance, zero maintenance civil infrastructures, the proposed project will investigate the potential of FRP/AC sandwich panels (that are cost effective, long lived, and lightweight), and concepts will be developed and feasibility demonstrated for construction of low cost building structures using the panel. FRP/AAC sandwich components will also be durable in severe environments including corrosion and against ballistic impact. The results of the program has the potential to provide commercial and residential building that is more energy efficient and cheaper than traditional construction. It also has some properties, in addition to those mentioned above, that may be of interest to the military and others responsible for protecting lives. The unique contribution of the effort will be the application of cost-effective VARTM (Vacuum Assisted Resin Infusion Molding process) processing using innovative FRP hardening schemes with recently developed glass-and carbon fiber architectures and vinyl ester as well as epoxy resin types. The proposed effort will also eliminate traditional hand lay-up processing techniques which prove to be expensive and time-wise inefficient, and simultaneously advanced the state of the art of usage of advanced composites in civil infrastructure.<br/><br/>This project, a first step towards the long-term goal, will address five fundamental queries: 1) Investigate cost-effective manufacturing of FRP/AC sandwich panels with damage tolerant architectures and new resin systems. 2) Perform material characterization and structural testing of FRP/AC sandwich panels through a comprehensive experimental program. The experimental studies are expected to provide an understanding of the (a) failure mechanisms of the proposed sandwich panels, (b) the strength, energy absorption, strain and modulus characteristics, (c) the role of the fiber-to-AC concrete interface, and (d) failure of the composite layers in the sandwich structure. 3) Develop concept and demonstrate the ballistic response of affordably produced sandwich panels that have promise to harden/strengthen without adding weigh penalty, and are cost-effective. 4) Understand the structural response of such structures through analytical simulations. 5) Develop modular systems to show how the FRP/AC panels can be used for a variety of types of building construction. Erection, assembly, and connections will be provided to clearly show how the construction can handle the material in the field. The proposed effort will explore the tangible benefits for wider application in structural engineering application areas. Finally, it was demonstrated in our previous study that the impact response of two proven materials- i.e., carbon fiber reinforced composite (CFRC) and glass fiber reinforced composite (GFRC), in conjunction with engineered Polycarbonate (PC) thermoplastic exhibits desirable failure mechanisms through indention of the Polycarbonate accompanied by delaminating at Polycarbonate-laminate interface rendering minimal damage to the laminate. The dynamic tests included ballistic impact loading conditions using a 30-cal sabot assisted projectile and high strain rate loading using compression Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar (SHPB). The rationale was that by providing a PC facing, the damage resistance of the composite structure could be enhanced, as the PC can absorb energy, with minimal weight penalty, and can serve the purpose of a sacrificial layer, that is easily repairable or replaceable. <br/><br/>Two graduate students and three undergraduate students will be involved in the project. They will be exposed to a wide range of technological issues crossing the boundaries of different engineering disciplines such as materials science, structural design, computer simulations, infrastructure analysis, hazard mitigation, and a variety of fabrication techniques at the University of Alabama (Birmingham) campus. The REUs will also organize demonstration for the high school students at the university high school on the UAB campus. The PI has had prior rewarding experiences working with REUs from diverse groups. <br/>",

        "abstractText": "With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Vaidya will conduct a year long investigation of the role, across stages of human development, of specific brain regions in mediating the ability to consciously record, retain, and recall past experience.  Late childhood is marked by rapid mastery of a variety of cognitive skills that are instrumental to educational, emotional, and social development.  One such cognitive skill is declarative memory, the ability to consciously record, retain, and recall past experience.  Between the ages of 7 and 13 years, the human brain undergoes profound physical changes that are thought to underlie improved memory abilities.  These childhood years are also marked by a great amount of individual variation such that children of the same age differ considerably in the level of memory performance.  Currently, there is little understanding of what specific brain changes mediate memory skills in childhood.  Dr. Vaidya's study examines how neural networks mediating memory for verbal materials differ in individuals of different ages and in individuals of the same age but different levels of memory performance.  Her study examines the role of two brain regions, medial temporal lobe and prefrontal cortex, in mediating memory in 7-9 year old children, 11-13 year old children, and 20-22 year old adults.  Functional magnetic resonance imaging is used to examine brain activity related to memories strengthened by the use of strategies and memories simply forgotten.<br/><br/>The findings in this study are expected to lead to important information about the neurobiology of memory development.  This work will advance the understanding of brain function and organization and its role in individual and developmental differences in a primary form of memory.  This work is also likely to have implications for understanding the effects of closed head injury in individuals of different age.<br/>",

        "abstractText": "       This Phase I Small Business Technology Transfer project aims to design advanced power conversion circuit schemes to meet the increasingly stringent power requirements for future computers. This includes development of optimized power system configurations, efficient power stage topologies and high performance control techniques. The design schemes will meet the industry requirements in terms of total harmonic distortion and power factor as well as EMI requirements. In Phase II, advanced packaging techniques and components and device optimization will be carried out. Using high-speed computers has become mandatory in all fields of application. The increasing desire for quick response, fast processing capability and for the multi-functioned features of computer systems drives the computer hardware design engineer to develop high-speed microprocessors. Meeting present and future power requirements for high-speed computers poses a real challenge to the technical community. Today's microprocessor technology enables the new generation processors operate as high as 500MHz. Designs for 800MHz and 1GHz are under way. The new generation integrated circuits are developed based on low-voltage (typically 2.6V to 3.3V) operation. Also the semiconductor companies are targeting chips running at 1.5V to 2V to operate at the GHz. speeds. The technical difficulties facing design engineers are numerous. As the voltage supply decreases, higher currents are needed to meet the required power rating, resulting in high power losses and thermal management problems. Due to the high load current requirements and wide current changes, technical challenges in designing fast dynamic response, low voltage ripple tolerance and short circuit current protection need to be addressed.<br/>       Potential users of the new designs are computer manufacturers and low voltage IC manufacturers that are used in communication equipment, consumer electronics, etc. The new power supply conversion technique will impact the entire computer industry. The next generation of computer speeds will be in the MHz range with voltage power supplies as low as 1.5volts at 100A. Even in today's computers at 200-400Mhz speeds, power losses are significant and suffer from slow dynamic response. As a result, computer power supplies are inefficient, bulky and expensive. Unlike the existing power conversion methods that based on the conventional scheme that uses voltage regulator modules from a 5V out put to the desired low output voltage, the proposed conversion scheme will be based on new topologies that will directly step down the voltage from line to the desired levels. We believe the new system configuration and topology selection will lead to a low-cost and improved power quality power supplies.<br/>",

Briefly, this model can be described using tow  parameters, say t and u.  The codes designed using the bit/byte  bounded model can tolerate up to t bit errors confined to a must u  bytes.  Unlike the existing approaches, the bit/byte bounded model  can interpolate between the traditional bit and 1 byte error  models.

        "abstractText": "Wireless communication technology has gained widespread acceptance in recent years.  Therefore, issues<br/>related to performance of transport protocols (such as TCP) over wireless links are of interest. The focus<br/>of this proposal is on TCP-unware techniques to improve TCP performance over paths that include wireless<br/>links.  The path from a TCP sender to a TCP receiver usually includes several intermediate nodes which may<br/>drop TCP packets if congestion occurs.  TCP makes the implicit assumption that all packet losses are due<br/>to congestion.  Since wireless links are prone to transmission errors, this assumption is not accurate for TCP<br/>over wireless links.  Nevertheless, TCP reduces its congestion window when packet losses due to transmission<br/>errors occur.  This phenomenon is known to result in poor throughput for TCP over wireless links.<br/>Existing approaches for improving TCP performance over wireless links require intermediate nodes to<br/>take TCP-speciffic actions { these approaches are said to be TCP-aware.  For instance, one such protocol<br/>requires that an intermediate node interpret TCP packets and drop some duplicate TCP acknowledgements<br/>when appropriate.  Such protocols are often not useful in practice.  For instance, when encryption is used for<br/>security, intermediate nodes may not be able to decipher contents of TCP packets.  Therefore, TCP-aware<br/>protocols cannot be used.<br/>                                                                                                                                                                                  The objective of this project is to investigate TCP-unaware mechanisms that do not require any inter-<br/>mediate node to take TCP-speciffic actions. The following issues will be investigated:<br/><br/>-  Design of TCP-unaware link layers that help improve TCP performance. The researchers will also consider other issues related to link layer design, including interaction of link layer with Random Early Detection (RED), providing diffierent reliability levels for TCP data and acknowledgements, and scheduling policies for link level retransmissions.<br/><br/>-  Sender-based heuristics for distinguishing between congestion losses and wireless losses:  Using such a<br/>heuristic, the sender can determine whether a packet was lost due to congestion or due to wireless<br/>transmission errors.  Knowing the cause of a packet loss, the sender can take appropriate action for each<br/>type of packet loss. The impact of such heuristics on TCP performance will be evaluated.<br/><br/>-  Receiver-based heuristics for distinguishing between congestion losses and wireless losses:  When the<br/>receiver is closer to a wireless link, it may be in a better position to diagnose whether a packet is lost<br/>due to wireless transmission errors or not.<br/><br/>-  Evaluation of a TCP-unaware approach that attempts to imitate a TCP-aware link layer mechanism.<br/>                                                                                                                                                                              The proposed techniques will be evaluated using simulations as well as experimentation on a wireless<br/>testbed built with AT&amp;T WaveLan technology.<br/>                                                                                                                                                                       Educational Impact: Results from the research proposed here will be published in technical conferences<br/>and journals.

        "abstractText": "The modern power grid is becoming increasingly complex. Ensuring stable grid operation is becoming more and more challenging. Classical tools for stability assessment for power systems largely rely on accurate system models. Such models are becoming less reliable as the grid continues to aggressively integrate new renewable, and often distributed, energy resources. Efficient computational tools are necessary to ensure reliable operation. This proposal seeks to develop such tools for stability monitoring, combining both coarse model information and real-time data streams from the power grid. Existing relationships with the power industry will play a crucial role in disseminating the research findings. Students working on this project will learn to utilize powerful techniques from modern data science that have applications in power systems. Research outcomes will be seamlessly integrated in multiple existing courses at both universities. <br/><br/>The proposed work leverages a linear transfer operator-based framework to build computational tools for stability monitoring, involving the Koopman and Perron-Frobenius operators. These operators are used to lift the nonlinear dynamics from state space to linear dynamics in the space of functions of the states. The eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of these operators are rich in information that is relevant to stability monitoring for a power grid. This work builds a framework to combine measurements of a subset of the states of a power system and a potentially coarse power system model to adaptively compute eigenvalues and eigenfunctions using kernel methods from machine learning. The eigenfunctions are then leveraged to estimate region of attraction of power system dynamics and propagate uncertainties in initial condition and model parameters. Special attention is paid to scalability of the approach to viably evaluate power system stability, in (almost) real-time. The proposed methods are fundamentally different from techniques that rely on local linearization that cannot capture the complex nonlinear behavior of power system dynamics. These methods are deeply rooted in dynamical systems theory and offer a natural mechanism to harness both model information and measurements from sensors within a unified framework.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

        "abstractText": "The overarching goal of the proposed research is to derive critical information and characterization of large scale generic nonlinear dynamical systems using limited observables. In the present state-of-the-art in data-driven dynamical system analysis, all the underlying state measurements and the time evolution of these states are required. Access to all of the dynamical states measurements in real-world is impossible or expensive. The objective of the proposal is to develop data-driven tools for dynamic system identification, classification and root-cause analysis of dynamic events, and prediction of system evolution. The research team will specifically conduct research on using available measurements to perform near real-time applications for various dynamic events that occur in electric power systems. The data analytics proposed are applicable to general non-linear dynamic systems and can be easily applied to other cyberphysical systems (CPS). More broadly, there is a large effort in the CPS and control community to model real world systems that we all interact with on a daily basis (such as transportation systems, communication networks, world wide web, etc.) as dynamical systems and thus, the theory and techniques developed through this project will enable online monitoring of these critical systems, allowing operators to quickly analyze these systems for any unstable/anomalous behavior from minimal data streams. The project will promote various educational and outreach activities including developing new courses, short courses, activities in schools, and scholarships for women and underrepresented minority students.   <br/><br/>Overview: The goal of this proposal is to develop operator theoretic data analytics techniques for dynamic systems with limited measurements to identify the underlying non-linear dynamical system and characterize their behavior such as causal interactions between constituent components, stability monitoring, identifying targets for control. The proposed research is in the domain of \"Technology for cyber-physical systems\". The novelty of the proposed methods is that they do not require the dynamic states but can utilize system outputs, making it applicable to real-world dynamical systems. Power systems are rapidly evolving with increased deployment of sensors like the phasor measurement units (PMUs) that have high accuracy and high sampling frequencies (up to 120 Hz).  These measurements will be used to develop an equivalent linear representation in a higher dimensional function space that can be used for online identification and characterization of nonlinear dynamics of the power grid. Further, machine learning techniques will be formulated to learn effective dictionary functions for the scalable deployment of proposed method. Using the proposed system identification method, the project will develop the theory and methodology for data-driven Information Transfer based causality mapping for detection and localization of system stress and dynamic coupling between the systems components. Specific applications for power grids will include stability monitoring, trajectory prediction and identification of targets for controlling adverse dynamic behavior. The methods are evaluated by an integrated power-cyber co-simulator (IPCC) that integrates power transmission, distribution and communication systems to generate synthetic sensor data for large systems under various dynamic scenarios. The IPCC will be able to model intermediate communication networks that cause measurement inconsistencies like delays, packet drop, etc. The Iowa State University's hardware in the loop cyber-physical testbed will be used to validate and evaluate some of the online applications like stability monitoring and trajectory prediction for large power grid topologies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

In mobile ad hoc networks, membership of a geocast group changes whenever hosts move in and out of the geocast region.                                                                                                                                                                                             Primary objective of this project is to develop flooding-based and tree-based approaches for geocasting in MANET and to evaluate their performance.  Performance evaluation will be based on simulations as well as a prototype implementation.  Because geocasts are directed towards a specified geocast region, use of directional antennas (instead of omnidirectional antennas) is expected to improve performance of geocasting in mobile ad hoc networks.

In this project, the researchers will investigate several protocol design issues corresponding to routing, medium-access control, and transport layers in mobile ad hoc networks. The focus is on performance issues related to individual layers as well as inter-layer interactions. Routing is recognized to be the central challenge in mobile ad hoc networks. Many routing protocols use on-demand network-wide flooding to locate the destination. The researchers propose to evaluate two techniques to localize flooding to only a limited region | one based on location information, and the other based on locality heuristics.  The proposed approaches are expected to reduce routing overhead as well as end-to-end packet delivery delays.  This project will also investigate medium-access control (MAC) designs that aid efficient routing.  In particular, the researchers  propose to evaluate multi-channel CSMA schemes that minimize multiple access interference at high load. These schemes are expected to reduce the detrimental effects of a broadcast flood.  Finally, this project will also consider the impact of MAC and routing protocols on transport protocol (particularly, TCP).

Distributed storage systems are designed to achieve a suitable tradeoff between latency, data consistency and dependability. This project addresses development of new consistency models that take into account application characteristics and hybrid fault models. The ultimate goal is to improve our understanding of the trade-offs between consistency, latency, and dependability in distributed storage systems.<br/> <br/>The project includes two synergistic thrusts. First, the project explores consistency models that consider graph-based application characteristics. For example, social and trust graphs model user relation and interaction for many applications. The first thrust explores graph-based consistency models that are acceptable for the applications, and yet improve latency of client operations. Second, prior storage systems typically either only tolerate benign failures, or tolerate worst-case faults with high overhead. This project considers non-colluding faults as well as Byzantine faults, and investigates approaches to reduce overhead by relaxing some of the requirements imposed by prior systems.<br/> <br/>Proposed research is expected to improve the understanding of the impact of application characteristics and different types of faults on consistency-latency trade-off in distributed storage systems. Tolerance of more severe faults is likely to become important for future critical web-based services and applications. Additionally, with the tremendous growth in social and trust networks, mechanisms to improve their performance are of interest.

        "abstractText": "As the penetration of smart controllable loads in the distribution system has been increasing, there has been a rising interest by utilities and ISOs to use these devices to improve the overall grid performance. Thermostatic controllable loads (TCLs) (heating, ventilation and air-conditioners (HVAC)) are rarely used for directly handling stability and security related issues. In this project, we systematically utilize the thermal storage of the HVAC systems to improve the security of the grid over various time scales (5 sec - 2 hrs).  While we will concentrate on enhancing system stability, the proposed DR aggregation and control methodology can be utilized for other services (emergency reserves, spinning reserves, load shaping, etc.) in a manner that ensures the customer comfort is not disrupted. The research results will be disseminated at relevant conferences.  Also, we plan to develop curriculum modules and short courses based on the research.<br/><br/>The uniqueness of the Demand Response(DR) aggregator with set-point control is that it reduces the control cost of DR imposed by frequent switching and reduces the likelihood of involuntary service interruption, enabling a more flexible, aggressive, and smooth demand control for a broad range of applications. A time-varying Extended Markov Model (EMM) is used in an online manner to control temperature set points of TCLs by taking into account the customer discomfort. The EMM is complimented by a time varying model predictive control (MPC) scheme to ensure effective control of TCLs to follow the reference power. The proposed scheme effectively broadens the set of available tools and resources to save the system at the onset of a severe event. The proposed approach monitors real-time voltage stability margin (VSM) and predicts VSM in a nonstationary operating environment and ensures that the customer dissatisfaction is limited while ensuring voltage stability via demand side control. The novel detection of the location and proportion of HVAC stalling devices using phasor measurement units (PMUs) &amp; micro-PMUs within 2-5 seconds ensures that relevant devices are selected for DR control, leading to an improvement in the short-term stability of the system. Also, to ensure that the reconnection does not induce synchronization of TCLs, an MPC formulation using EMMs is solved to determine the effective reconnection scheme.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

        "abstractText": "Undergraduate students' persistence in STEM is heavily influenced by their classroom experiences, particularly in entry-level mathematics courses. Considerable research has been conducted showing that improved instruction by full-time faculty can increase student motivation and persistence in mathematics courses. However, entry-level courses, such as precalculus, are often taught by adjunct and other part-time instructors, who traditionally have tended to be offered only minimal professional development and support for teaching undergraduate mathematics. Thus, there is a pressing need to focus on developing instructional practices among adjunct and other part-time instructors. This project will build a model of course coordination and adjunct instructor support to improve the teaching and learning of precalculus. <br/><br/>While some work has been done to understand the benefits of supports for part-time instructors at the undergraduate level, this work has focused mostly on graduate teaching assistants rather than adjunct instructors. The proposed project will extend this work to adjunct instructors and will contribute to the research base regarding the adjunct instructor population. By building a model of adjunct instructor resources and support, the project will contribute to deeper understanding of how such efforts impact (1) adjunct instructor knowledge and instructional practices, (2) adjunct instructor job satisfaction, and (3) student academic success and retention in STEM majors. This understanding will help other departments and institutions with similar instructor populations to better support their adjunct faculty, with the goal of improving student learning and persistence in precalculus and beyond.",

        "abstractText": "Recent years have seen a tremendous growth in the popularity of cloud services. Distributed storage systems are a key component of the cloud computing revolution. Distributed storage systems are designed to achieve a suitable tradeoff between latency, data consistency and dependability. This project addresses development of new consistency models that take into account application characteristics and hybrid fault models. The ultimate goal is to improve our understanding of the trade-offs between consistency, latency, and dependability in distributed storage systems.<br/> <br/>The project includes two synergistic thrusts. First, the project explores consistency models that consider graph-based application characteristics. For example, social and trust graphs model user relation and interaction for many applications. The first thrust explores graph-based consistency models that are acceptable for the applications, and yet improve latency of client operations. Second, prior storage systems typically either only tolerate benign failures, or tolerate worst-case faults with high overhead. This project considers non-colluding faults as well as Byzantine faults, and investigates approaches to reduce overhead by relaxing some of the requirements imposed by prior systems.<br/> <br/>Proposed research is expected to improve the understanding of the impact of application characteristics and different types of faults on consistency-latency trade-off in distributed storage systems. Tolerance of more severe faults is likely to become important for future critical web-based services and applications. Additionally, with the tremendous growth in social and trust networks, mechanisms to improve their performance are of interest. This project helps achieve such improvements through the development of new consistency models. Additionally, the project provides research opportunities to undergraduate and graduate students, and a post-doctoral researcher.<br/><br/>The data from the project is to be retained for at least two years after the completion of this project, and stored in local computers and online shared storage.

Research in computational geometry with a special emphasis on problems  defined on a set of points in high dimension is conducted. Such  high dimensional problems arise routinely in classification, pattern  recognition, vision, and speech recognition.

In particular, all known data   structures that achieve a sub-linear worst-case query time,   require an astronomical amount of storage and preprocessing.

        "title": "Analysis and Control of Complex Behavior: Linear Transfer Operator Approach",
        "abstractText": "This proposal introduces a novel framework for the analysis and control of nonlinear systems exhibiting complex dynamics. The underlying idea of the framework is to study the evolution of sets in the phase space as opposed to the conventional point-wise approach. The advantage of the approach is that the evolution of sets is linear and is described by a linear transfer Perron-Frobenius operator. The linear nature of the framework allows us to carry our intuition from linear systems, a mature area of research, to nonlinear systems. A perfect example is the introduction of Lyapunov measure as a new tool to verify a set-theoretic notion of ?almost everywhere? stability in nonlinear systems. Lyapunov measure is shown to be dual to the Lyapunov function and a linear program using the finite dimensional approximation of the Perron-Frobenius operator is proposed for its computation. The proposed research exploits the linearity of the framework for the model order reduction and parameter identification in systems exhibiting complex dynamics with applications in jet engines. The framework also provides a systematic procedure based on the linear programming for the control of complex dynamics. The proposed research uses this procedure for the problem of control of mixing in fluid flows with potential application in analyzing the transport and mixing properties of large-scale oceanographic and atmospheric flows. <br/><br/>The success of this research will result in a new set of tools and methods that are general enough to be applied in diverse fields, such as fluid dynamics and mechanical systems. The reduced order model in jet engines will be used in better control design, which ultimately results in less fuel consumption and increased life of engines. The improved control algorithm for mixing will benefit the pharmaceutical, petrochemical, transportation, and power generation industries among others. The PI?s collaboration with United Technologies Research Center will help in transferring the know-how from industry to academia, and vice versa. As the part of the education plan, the PI will introduce interdisciplinary courses on nonlinear dynamics at the undergraduate and graduate levels. By serving as a faculty mentor for the special interest group in robotics, the PI will help increase the involvement of undergraduate students in research.  <br/>",

The                        principle objective of this project to develop query optimizer                  that will generate efficient query plans for parallel machines.                 The three main components of a database query optimizer are its                 query plan representation, its cost model, and its search                       algorithm.  This project addresses the issue of developing a plan               representation that incorporates intra- and inter-operator                      parallelism, as well as pipelining.  Furthermore, cost models                   will be developed which distinguish between the total work done,                i.e. the (sequential) time it would take on a uni-processor and                 total (parallel) time taken on a multi-processor.  The cost model               depends on the query and database parameters, as well as                        architecture parameters.  A cost-based search algorithm selects                 efficient (low cost) query plans.  Since the search space is much               larger than that found in uni-processor query optimization, this                research will develop new heuristics to prune the search space.                 Furthermore, since a multiprocessor is available, the research                  will also investigate applicability of parallel processing to the               optimization process itself.

        "abstractText": "Providing restrictive and secure access to resources is a challenging and socially important problem. Security analysis helps organizations gain confidence on the control they have on resources while providing access, and helps them devise and maintain policies. There is a dire need for analysis tools to help administrators ensure security as they make administrative changes to reflect changes in policy. Security analysis of access control is non-trivial for an administrator due to the complexity of reasoning with the beguiling number of possible future scenarios.  Techniques for the analysis of security in access control is in its infancy.  The goal of this project is to go beyond decidability/undecidability issues, and go forth to build scalable and usable security analysis tools and techniques when access control is deployed via the most commonly used role-based access control (RBAC) models or its spatiotemporal extensions.<br/><br/>The main thesis of this project is that finding breaches of security in an access control model is very similar to finding errors in a program.  Some of the innovative expected results include: accurate mapping of the security problem for policies in access control as reachability problems in transition systems, including succinct discrete systems and automata with spatio-temporal constraints; scalable techniques to search for security breaches by exploiting the model-checking techniques developed by the program verification community; usable and useful tools for administrators to express policies and  automatically find breaches of their security policies. The project helps in building technical bridges between the communities of access control security and formal methods in verification, which is expected to trigger a flurry of research, possibly unifying problems in the two fields, and initiating each other with new ideas.  Scalable and usable security analysis will also serve needs in many settings including emergency, disaster management and homeland security applications. The tools will be included as modules in a tele-medicine system and an emergency management system. The integration of the ideas, techniques, and tools resulting from this project into the education curriculum will positively impact the quality of a newly trained workforce that is prepared to meet security challenges, making them aware of security issues in access control, and educating them on practical ways to check for breaches in security.",

Currently, privacy is only informally studied, perhaps as a small part of a general information security course, or even ignored when cybersecurity cannot find a place in the curriculum, as happens with many regional colleges and universities. The project examines how privacy can be incorporated into the undergraduate curriculum at the appropriate level by identifying and developing a comprehensive set of portable course modules and lab extensions that would appropriately cover the key concepts and introduce privacy tools, techniques, and methodologies. By developing course outlines at different levels of granularity and corresponding instructional materials, retention and learning of the important concepts at different scopes and levels of the undergraduate curriculum can be ensured. The modular approach ensures that the developed curricular materials are useful for a variety of undergraduate institutions. An integral aim of the project is to find the right applications to introduce the key concepts of privacy to undergraduates along with the state of the art technological, sociological, and legal solutions, enabling integration of the difficult concepts and their retention.

Distributed robotic systems are at the frontier of research in manufacturing, transportation, logistics, and exploration. Yet, managing and experimenting with distributed robotic platforms can be a laborious and error-prone undertaking. Deploying a new algorithm on an existing hardware platform can take weeks; porting an application to a new platform can take months. This high overhead of deploying robotic applications takes a toll on the robustness of the scientific claims made in this area. CyPhyHouse provides application programming interfaces (APIs) and an easy to use software environment which reduces the above efforts by orders of magnitude. This new infrastructure provides easy to use, open source, software and hardware platform for rapidly programming, simulating, deploying, and visualizing a rich family of applications on heterogeneous fleet of vehicles. It thus will enable large-scale experimental research needed for developing computing systems that support and rely on coordinated and controlled mobility, for example, in the study of mobility of WiFi access points, debuggers for mobile systems, and augmented-reality with real and virtual Unmanned Autonomous Vehicles.<br/><br/>The hardware infrastructure consists of a collection of about mobile vehicle platforms (a mix of ground vehicles and aerial vehicles). The software infrastructure consists of APIs for coordination and control of the heterogeneous fleet based on distributed shared-memory (DSM) and reach-avoid functions. These APIs are integrated in an extension of a familiar programming language (e.g., C++ or Java) and have implementations on all the hardware platforms. Supporting software tools are developed for compilation, simulation, logging, and monitoring that help with development and deployment of application programs. The infrastructure enables a researcher to quickly deploy experiments involving dozens of vehicles and  visualize them. The same high-level application programs will be portable across different hardware platforms. The platform enables large-scale, repeatable experimental research needed for developing computing systems that support and rely on coordinated and controlled mobility.  All the software and hardware specifications will be open-sourced and made available to the broader community. In several graduate courses, CyPhyHouse will provide students with a realistic platform for projects.

Drexel University intends to recruit twenty-four individuals earning a baccalaureate degree in a STEM discipline and to prepare them to become teachers of mathematics and science in urban high-need school districts.  It is expected that these STEM majors will earn a minor in education and will contribute to the teacher workforce in the School District of Philadelphia and Philadelphia charter schools.  In addition to recruiting and preparing these Noyce Scholars to be successful in teaching in urban middle schools, the project seeks to retain them in the system for at least five years.  Undergraduate coursework will be supplemented with clinical field, tutoring, and pre-residency and residency experiences.  The program participants will be immersed in pedagogical experiences and discussions related to their discipline and to teaching in high-need urban schools.  These Noyce Scholars will continue to receive mentoring during their first three years of teaching; this mentoring will be provided by the University's newly established Early Career Practitioner Institute.  To support the Noyce Scholars and create a professional community of teacher learners, the Scholars will also have an opportunity to participate in summer workshops, work with project staff during periodic site visits, attend professional conferences, and participate in an online social network created in support of this project.  In addition, Scholars will receive support and mentoring from university faculty.  By creating and sustaining this community of teacher-learners, the project aims to create a cadre of highly qualified middle-grades mathematics and science teachers for high-need urban schools.<br/><br/>The project will use recent scientific, mathematical, and educational knowledge to prepare and support the twenty-four pre-service teacher candidates with an emphasis on understanding the culture and life experiences of students in high-need schools.   The project intends to promote social justice teaching, which emphasizes connecting science, mathematics, and engineering instruction to students' personal experiences and culture.  This connection can leverage the funds of knowledge that each student brings to learning.  Inquiry-based instruction supports this approach as it opens communication among students by establishing a learning community of shared knowledge and experience.  Seminars related to mindfulness and developing emotional intelligence will augment the Scholars' coursework.  The latter will be scaffolded to develop the following behaviors: professionalism, growth mindset, commitment to serving all students well, and cultural competency.  Essential skills that will be developed through the coursework include understanding students' cultural communities as a foundation for classroom culture and building strong relationships, taking ownership of student learning and professional growth, setting and maintaining high behavioral expectations, leading rigorous and aligned content instruction, and demonstrating content expertise and pedagogical content knowledge.  These essential skills and core competencies will be demonstrated in the context of teaching mathematics and science to middle-grades students in high-need schools.  Early experiences consisting of linking content knowledge with appropriate pedagogical and content knowledge with pre-residency and residency experiences are intended to strengthen the Scholars' content and pedagogical knowledge while supporting first steps into the world of teaching.  Rubrics to assess the attainment of the core competencies and essential skills will be used to collect data related to the Scholars' proficiency in these aspects.  It is anticipated that the documentation of project activities and identification of learnings from project implementation will be disseminated to the education community through conference presentations, a project website, and professional publications.  The long-term and far-reaching benefits to society of this project are the potential to document and share sustainable approaches, steeped in the context of social-justice, for recruiting and preparing STEM majors to provide success in learning mathematics and science for all middle-grades students in a high-need school district.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

        "title": "SM: Student Travel Grant for SIAM Data Mining Conference 2008",
        "abstractText": "The investigator will use the funds from this grant to support the travel of students to the 2008 SIAM Data Mining (SDM 2008) Conference on Data Mining. This conference will be held in Atlanta, USA from April 24th to April 26th, 2008 (http://www.siam.org/meetings/sdm08/).<br/>Jointly organized by computer scientists and statisticians, this technical conference is a premiere venue for presenting new research results in the area of data mining, and is widely attended by researchers and practitioners in the field. Selection of award recipients will be done on the basis of quality of their research progress, as well as the potential to benefit from attending this meeting. Special emphasis will be given to graduate students, and in particular women and under-represented minority students, since attending conferences is an important part of their educational experience, and they often have limited travel funds.<br/><br/>Attending conferences such as SDM is of paramount importance for the development of graduate students. Participants have the opportunity to present their work, attend panel and keynote sessions, and interact with hundreds of others performing leading-edge research in the field.<br/>Such experiences help students in a number of ways ways. First, it enables them to get exposure to a wide range of cutting edge ideas in their field, beyond what they are likely to be exposed to in their home institutions and research groups. Second, it provides them an opportunity to meet established researchers, which can potentially lead to long term interactions and mentoring relationships. Third, in case they are presenting a paper, it provides an opportunity for early feedback on their thesis research and presentation skills from a broad audience. All of these benefits are invaluable in ensuring the development of research excellence, leading to a productive career in innovative research. Given that cutting edge innovation is critical to the United States' economic preeminence in the world, and a future workforce trained to be innovative is critical for it, the proposed project is well aligned with the national agenda.<br/><br/>",

        "title": "Cache Coherence in Wormhole Networks",
        "abstractText": "This project is investigating the use of wormhole networks in supporting cache-  coherent multiprocessors.  Cache coherence gtraffic, characterized by fixed  length messages that arrive in bursts, is generated by an execution-driven  simulator.  This traffic is used to evaluate alternative message scheduling  schemes, adaptive routing schemes, virtual channels, and interface designs.  New  coherence and synchronization schemes are being developed and evaluated as part  of this research.    The project is divided into three phases.  In the first phase the effect of  congestion in the interconnection network in performane of cache-coherent  multiprocessors is being investigated.  The second phase emphasizes the  development of techniques to reduce cache coherence traffic and invalidation  time.  The third phase is the development of new protocols that use wormhole  networks effectively.",

The equipment is useful for several projects, including:     (1) Real-time communication in heterogeneous networks: This project develops techniques for guaranteeing deadlines in heterogeneous networks popular in mission-critical systems. Requested equipment enables experimentation with a network consisting of ATM and FDDI.     (2) Algorithms for distributed systems management: Algorithms are developed for managing performance and faults in distributed systems, using formal analysis and experimentation. Realistic assessment requires a dedicated cluster of homogeneous workstations to allow undisrupted testing and trend prediction.
